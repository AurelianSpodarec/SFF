# Super Flexible Framework

Super Flexibile Framework, shorten to SFF, is a framework I have designed to help me setting up the initial code for the projects. 

Everytime when we start a project, we need to create folder, define variables do this and that. 

I have created a dynamic like website, which is nothing like Bootstrap or Materialise. You have 100% control over everything. If you want a new button, you add it in the setting file, and create the class of the button name - its that easy!

I have put everything that we might use, mixins, mixins for flexbox, general classes and so forth. 

The framework is new, and there will be a lot of changes. 

Will update when I'v done more :D
